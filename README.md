# SkyChain Notebook

A [literate programming](http://literateprogramming.com/) tool that makes it easy to interact, edit, visualize and, share code.

## Development

```bash
git clone ...
cd skychain-notebook
cargo run
```

### Etiquette

1. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
    * commit prefix types:
      * `feat` - see standard
      * `fix` - see standard
      * `docs` - modifying the documents in some way
      * `chore` - modifying something trivial - spelling mistake, version bumps etc.

### Roadmap

## Information

### Motivation

You can read the [manifesto](docs/motivation/manifesto.md) if you like, but, ultimately, the reasons are '_[rewrite it in rust](https://github.com/casey/awesome-rewrite-it-in-rust)_' and '_why not?_'
